# Uninformative Error from `expo prebuild` Command

This repository demonstrates a problem with the Expo CLI's `expo prebuild` command.  After making changes to the project, the `expo prebuild` command fails with a vague error message that doesn't provide enough information to diagnose the underlying issue. The lack of specificity in the error message makes debugging very difficult.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Attempt to run `expo prebuild`. Observe the generic error message.

## Potential Causes

The root cause of this problem could vary greatly depending on the specific project configuration and the nature of the changes made before running `expo prebuild`.  Possibilities include:

* Issues with native dependencies (iOS or Android)
* Problems in the build configuration files
* Conflicts between Expo modules and native libraries

## Solution

This issue is often resolved by carefully reviewing the logs for more clues. If a specific module or build step is mentioned, focus troubleshooting efforts there.  Sometimes cleaning the build cache or re-installing native dependencies can help. In some cases, you may need to examine the native iOS/Android projects directly to find the specific error.
