While building an Expo app, I encountered an unusual error related to the `expo prebuild` command.  After making changes to my project's dependencies or modifying native code, the `expo prebuild` command would fail with an error message that wasn't very informative. The error message would indicate a problem during the prebuild process, but wouldn't point to the specific source of the issue.  It would sometimes mention issues related to the native iOS or Android projects, but lacked specific details about what went wrong.
