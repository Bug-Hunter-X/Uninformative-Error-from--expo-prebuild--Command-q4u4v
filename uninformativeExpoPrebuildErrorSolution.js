To improve the chances of getting a more helpful error message, try the following:

1. **Verbose Logging:** Run `expo prebuild --verbose`. This provides more detailed output which may reveal the root cause of the error. 
2. **Clean the Build Cache:**  Delete the build cache for both iOS and Android. On the iOS side, this usually involves deleting the `ios/build` directory. The location of Android's build cache depends on your build system.
3. **Reinstall Native Dependencies:** Remove and re-install the native dependencies.  This can often resolve issues due to corrupted or inconsistent dependencies.
4. **Inspect Native Project Logs:** If the issue appears related to a native project (iOS or Android), try to directly open and build that project using Xcode or Android Studio. The native build system may produce more informative error messages.
5. **Check Expo SDK Version:**  Ensure that you're using a compatible Expo SDK version and that all your dependencies support that SDK version. 
6. **Simplify the Project:** In extreme cases, try to isolate the problem by creating a minimal reproducible example. This can help identify the specific cause of the error.
